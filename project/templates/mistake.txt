‚ùå YOUR MISTAKE: Using POST-only routes for actions triggered by buttons
1. üîò You used <button onclick="location.href='form.html'>
This is not a form submission.

This is just a GET request to a URL, like clicking a normal link.

It does not send any form data.

So this ‚Üí


<button onclick="location.href='form.html'">Create Post</button>
...sends a GET request to /form.html.




2. ‚ùóYour FastAPI route for /form.html was defined only as:


@app.post("/form.html")

This route only accepts POST requests.

But your button triggered a GET request.

So FastAPI returned:




{"detail": "Method Not Allowed"}
‚úÖ The Fix: Support GET to show the form, and POST to submit it

Now you‚Äôve correctly added:


python......


@app.get("/form.html")  # To show the form when button is clicked
@app.post("/form.html")  # To handle form submission
That way:

GET shows the page with the form.

POST receives the data from the form and processes it.
